# The-pet-Game
Pet game is an event-based program, which means the functions it performs and the order in which it performs all functions is dependent on user input. In such programs, user input can take any form, such as keypresses and mouse clicks.

Below are the three features that our screen pet will perform:

Happy Face: When you will click on it with the mouse the screen pet will blush and it will look happy.

Cheeky Face: If you double-click it, then it will show its tongue to you.

Sad Face: If you ignore it then it will become sad and the point where you click then it will become happy again.
